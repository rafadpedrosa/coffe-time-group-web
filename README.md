# coffe-time-group-web
This a project to solve a coffe problem in my actual company. It uses Angular + bootstrap + firebase

## The problem
Let me tell you a tale... Once upon a time, in my actual (14/11/2018) company, there is a big automated machine that makes coffee, tea and milk chocolate for all the employees. But we - a group of 20 people - loved so much coffee that we bought a italian coffee maker for us. It's not the best from the market but we love "her" S2. 

PS: yep, the coffee from the big machin is terrible.

So! After 6 moths of use, it starts to have some problens mainly because of the resistence. We use it a LOT and the coffee maker stays on during for almoust 7 hours per day. I'm not completely sure but i think that's it. Also, we was forgetting to turn off it at the end of the day which is the biggest problem, the misuse :'( 

R.I.P - Coffee maker nº1

We bought another coffee make - coffe maker nº2 - and we are avoiding the misuse! We are paying attention, trying to be alert in the end of the day and torning off it. Despite that, we still forgetting to turning it off. Not as much as we was before, but we still forgeting.

But that history is just one problem. 

We don't know...

How much coffe left we have to drink.
How many coffe and sugar bags we have left.
How many money we have left (yes! We all chipped in to have money for coffe bags, sugar and bought for the  coffe maker)

So, I think: well I'm a developer trying to improove my github which love to study and learn new techs and... Why not create a program to solve our problem? Hmmmm... LETZ DO THAT! 

So, for now, what I want to solve for now is:

0. cofig to set values for the system
1. Coffe left
2. Materials left
3. Money left
4. Expense History
5. Notitications (push notifications):
  5.1 Coffee is ready to drink!
  5.2 Turn off me please!
  5.3 I'm out of materials!
  5.4 Some one turn me off today
  5.5 Good, we don't have money left! We need to chipe in again

I think that's good for a 1.1 version. 

After the user i'm pretty sure that others requests are coming.
